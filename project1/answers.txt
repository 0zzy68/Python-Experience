For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.

Part 2a:

AT-content: 0.274056462962963

Part 2b:

A count: 7467696
T count: 7331353
G count: 6103168
C count: 6075218

Part 2c:
(On sample_5.fastq)
sum is 75
Total count is:  76
Length is  76

Explanation:

I found the answer by looking at every single file and comparing the answers. I decided to open up the smaller ones that had less than 100 bases of nucleotides so that it would be easier and quicker to examine the bases. I found out that the linenum if statement basically only reads the line with the nucleotides on it which is what allows for it to not have a larger length.

There is a discrepancy between them all except for test-small.fastq because of the N on every fourth line factors into the length and total_count, where as the other (sum) only factors in 'A','T','C', or 'G'. The difference is harder to notice on the longer nucleotide strings because there is a lot more data to take in.

The GC content can be calculated using sum, but not count and length because they factor in things like the N at start of every nucleotide chain. My program incorrectly counted GC count.


Part 2d:

2d. Ratio is 1.874760643552641

Part 2e:

moderate GC content
